# rack-galaxy-s3-exploit

This *was* a Rack middleware gem, intended to show people the potential dangers of the [exploit](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4569686) discovered in the Samsung Galaxy S3 which allows web pages to (purportedly) wipe someone's phone. The middleware functions by inserting the offending tag into every HTML page served.

This was intended as a proof-of-concept; a demo as it were. People weren't very happy with it however, and seem not to appreciate this. I do understand the issue though, of course, I just hoped people would be mature and not use this for evil. I understand the concern though so I'm taking this down.
